Grid based platformer. Every x seconds / checkpoint / portal you switch worlds.

There is a platforming world and a combat world? Platforming world is bright, sunny and happy. Combat world is dark and creepy like Terraria corruption.
Screen transition is like Pokemon Gen III poison damage. Screen goes all pixely.

Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde. Dr. Jekyll and Kyle Hyde.

Player has knife. WASD to move. Arrows to stab in 8 cardinal directions.
Player related to Rick. Insane? Bandaged Eye like Polly.

Normal world is pure platforming / parkour. Every time you fall you enter the corrupt world and must fight to get back to the surface.

Enemy Ideas:
	Normal world:

	Corrupt world:
		Bat
		Slime (3 stages. One really big, when killed spawns two medium, each spawn two small. Can spawn as big or medium.)
		Zombie

	Normal world:
		Rabbit (Does not jump or fight.)
		Bowyer
		? Military stuff (Tank, helicoptor, etc.)

	Boss ? (Same as Rick?)

Win condition or just arcade?
