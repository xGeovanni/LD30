Grid based platformer. Every x seconds / checkpoint you switch worlds.

There is a platforming world and a combat world? Platforming world is bright, sy=unny and happy. Combat world is dark and creepy like Terraria corruption.
Screen transition is like Pokemon Gen III poison damage. Screen goes all pixely.
